      "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbtrfs: fix deadlock when cloning inline extents and using qgroups\n\nThere are a few exceptional cases where cloning an inline extent needs to\ncopy the inline extent data into a page of the destination inode.\n\nWhen this happens, we end up starting a transaction while having a dirty\npage for the destination inode and while having the range locked in the\ndestination's inode iotree too. Because when reserving metadata space\nfor a transaction we may need to flush existing delalloc in case there is\nnot enough free space, we have a mechanism in place to prevent a deadlock,\nwhich was introduced in commit 3d45f221ce627d (\"btrfs: fix deadlock when\ncloning inline extent and low on free metadata space\").\n\nHowever when using qgroups, a transaction also reserves metadata qgroup\nspace, which can also result in flushing delalloc in case there is not\nenough available space at the moment. When this happens we deadlock, since\nflushing delalloc requires locking the file range in the inode's iotree\nand the range was already locked at the very beginning of the clone\noperation, before attempting to start the transaction.\n\nWhen this issue happens, stack traces like the following are reported:\n\n  [72747.556262] task:kworker/u81:9   state:D stack:    0 pid:  225 ppid:     2 flags:0x00004000\n  [72747.556268] Workqueue: writeback wb_workfn (flush-btrfs-1142)\n  [72747.556271] Call Trace:\n  [72747.556273]  __schedule+0x296/0x760\n  [72747.556277]  schedule+0x3c/0xa0\n  [72747.556279]  io_schedule+0x12/0x40\n  [72747.556284]  __lock_page+0x13c/0x280\n  [72747.556287]  ? generic_file_readonly_mmap+0x70/0x70\n  [72747.556325]  extent_write_cache_pages+0x22a/0x440 [btrfs]\n  [72747.556331]  ? __set_page_dirty_nobuffers+0xe7/0x160\n  [72747.556358]  ? set_extent_buffer_dirty+0x5e/0x80 [btrfs]\n  [72747.556362]  ? update_group_capacity+0x25/0x210\n  [72747.556366]  ? cpumask_next_and+0x1a/0x20\n  [72747.556391]  extent_writepages+0x44/0xa0 [btrfs]\n  [72747.556394]  do_writepages+0x41/0xd0\n  [72747.556398]  __writeback_single_inode+0x39/0x2a0\n  [72747.556403]  writeback_sb_inodes+0x1ea/0x440\n  [72747.556407]  __writeback_inodes_wb+0x5f/0xc0\n  [72747.556410]  wb_writeback+0x235/0x2b0\n  [72747.556414]  ? get_nr_inodes+0x35/0x50\n  [72747.556417]  wb_workfn+0x354/0x490\n  [72747.556420]  ? newidle_balance+0x2c5/0x3e0\n  [72747.556424]  process_one_work+0x1aa/0x340\n  [72747.556426]  worker_thread+0x30/0x390\n  [72747.556429]  ? create_worker+0x1a0/0x1a0\n  [72747.556432]  kthread+0x116/0x130\n  [72747.556435]  ? kthread_park+0x80/0x80\n  [72747.556438]  ret_from_fork+0x1f/0x30\n\n  [72747.566958] Workqueue: btrfs-flush_delalloc btrfs_work_helper [btrfs]\n  [72747.566961] Call Trace:\n  [72747.566964]  __schedule+0x296/0x760\n  [72747.566968]  ? finish_wait+0x80/0x80\n  [72747.566970]  schedule+0x3c/0xa0\n  [72747.566995]  wait_extent_bit.constprop.68+0x13b/0x1c0 [btrfs]\n  [72747.566999]  ? finish_wait+0x80/0x80\n  [72747.567024]  lock_extent_bits+0x37/0x90 [btrfs]\n  [72747.567047]  btrfs_invalidatepage+0x299/0x2c0 [btrfs]\n  [72747.567051]  ? find_get_pages_range_tag+0x2cd/0x380\n  [72747.567076]  __extent_writepage+0x203/0x320 [btrfs]\n  [72747.567102]  extent_write_cache_pages+0x2bb/0x440 [btrfs]\n  [72747.567106]  ? update_load_avg+0x7e/0x5f0\n  [72747.567109]  ? enqueue_entity+0xf4/0x6f0\n  [72747.567134]  extent_writepages+0x44/0xa0 [btrfs]\n  [72747.567137]  ? enqueue_task_fair+0x93/0x6f0\n  [72747.567140]  do_writepages+0x41/0xd0\n  [72747.567144]  __filemap_fdatawrite_range+0xc7/0x100\n  [72747.567167]  btrfs_run_delalloc_work+0x17/0x40 [btrfs]\n  [72747.567195]  btrfs_work_helper+0xc2/0x300 [btrfs]\n  [72747.567200]  process_one_work+0x1aa/0x340\n  [72747.567202]  worker_thread+0x30/0x390\n  [72747.567205]  ? create_worker+0x1a0/0x1a0\n  [72747.567208]  kthread+0x116/0x130\n  [72747.567211]  ? kthread_park+0x80/0x80\n  [72747.567214]  ret_from_fork+0x1f/0x30\n\n  [72747.569686] task:fsstress        state:D stack:    \n---truncated---",

When this happens we deadlock, since\nflushing delalloc requires locking the file range in the inode's iotree\nand the range was already locked at the very beginning of the clone\noperation, before attempting to start the transaction.\n\nWhen this issue happens, stack traces like the following are reported:\n\n  [72747.556262] task:kworker/u81:9   state:D stack:    0 pid:  225 ppid:     2 flags:0x00004000\n  [72747.556268] Workqueue: writeback wb_workfn (flush-btrfs-1142)\n  [72747.556271] Call Trace:\n  [72747.556273]  __schedule+0x296/0x760\n  [72747.556277]  schedule+0x3c/0xa0\n  [72747.556279]  io_schedule+0x12/0x40\n  [72747.556284]  __lock_page+0x13c/0x280\n  [72747.556287]  ? generic_file_readonly_mmap+0x70/0x70\n  [72747.556325]  extent_write_cache_pages+0x22a/0x440 [btrfs]\n  [72747.556331]  ? __set_page_dirty_nobuffers+0xe7/0x160\n  [72747.556358]  ? set_extent_buffer_dirty+0x5e/0x80 [btrfs]\n  [72747.556362]  ? update_group_capacity+0x25/0x210\n  [72747.556366]  ? cpumask_next_and+0x1a/0x20\n  [72747.556391]  extent_writepages+0x44/0xa0 [btrfs]\n  [72747.556394]  do_writepages+0x41/0xd0\n  [72747.556398]  __writeback_single_inode+0x39/0x2a0\n  [72747.556403]  writeback_sb_inodes+0x1ea/0x440\n  [72747.556407]  __writeback_inodes_wb+0x5f/0xc0\n  [72747.556410]  wb_writeback+0x235/0x2b0\n  [72747.556414]  ? get_nr_inodes+0x35/0x50\n  [72747.556417]  wb_workfn+0x354/0x490\n  [72747.556420]  ? newidle_balance+0x2c5/0x3e0\n  [72747.556424]  process_one_work+0x1aa/0x340\n  [72747.556426]  worker_thread+0x30/0x390\n  [72747.556429]  ? create_worker+0x1a0/0x1a0\n  [72747.556432]  kthread+0x116/0x130\n  [72747.556435]  ? kthread_park+0x80/0x80\n  [72747.556438]  ret_from_fork+0x1f/0x30\n\n  [72747.566958] Workqueue: btrfs-flush_delalloc btrfs_work_helper [btrfs]\n  [72747.566961] Call Trace:\n  [72747.566964]  __schedule+0x296/0x760\n  [72747.566968]  ? finish_wait+0x80/0x80\n  [72747.566970]  schedule+0x3c/0xa0\n  [72747.566995]  wait_extent_bit.constprop.68+0x13b/0x1c0 [btrfs]\n  [72747.566999]  ? finish_wait+0x80/0x80\n  [72747.567024]  lock_extent_bits+0x37/0x90 [btrfs]\n  [72747.567047]  btrfs_invalidatepage+0x299/0x2c0 [btrfs]\n  [72747.567051]  ? find_get_pages_range_tag+0x2cd/0x380\n  [72747.567076]  __extent_writepage+0x203/0x320 [btrfs]\n  [72747.567102]  extent_write_cache_pages+0x2bb/0x440 [btrfs]\n  [72747.567106]  ? update_load_avg+0x7e/0x5f0\n  [72747.567109]  ? enqueue_entity+0xf4/0x6f0\n  [72747.567134]  extent_writepages+0x44/0xa0 [btrfs]\n  [72747.567137]  ? enqueue_task_fair+0x93/0x6f0\n  [72747.567140]  do_writepages+0x41/0xd0\n  [72747.567144]  __filemap_fdatawrite_range+0xc7/0x100\n  [72747.567167]  btrfs_run_delalloc_work+0x17/0x40 [btrfs]\n  [72747.567195]  btrfs_work_helper+0xc2/0x300 [btrfs]\n  [72747.567200]  process_one_work+0x1aa/0x340\n  [72747.567202]  worker_thread+0x30/0x390\n  [72747.567205]  ? create_worker+0x1a0/0x1a0\n  [72747.567208]  kthread+0x116/0x130\n  [72747.567211]  ? kthread_park+0x80/0x80\n  [72747.567214]  ret_from_fork+0x1f/0x30\n\n  [72747.569686] task:fsstress        state:D stack:    \n---truncated---",

      "description": "Normally in OpenSSL EC groups always have a co-factor present and this is used in side channel resistant code paths. However, in some cases, it is possible to construct a group using explicit parameters (instead of using a named curve). In those cases it is possible that such a group does not have the cofactor present. This can occur even where all the parameters match a known named curve. If such a curve is used then OpenSSL falls back to non-side channel resistant code paths which may result in full key recovery during an ECDSA signature operation. In order to be vulnerable an attacker would have to have the ability to time the creation of a large number of signatures where explicit parameters with no co-factor present are in use by an application using libcrypto. For the avoidance of doubt libssl is not vulnerable because explicit parameters are never used. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1d (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1c). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.0l (Affected 1.1.0-1.1.0k).

      "description": "The X509_V_FLAG_X509_STRICT flag enables additional security checks of the certificates present in a certificate chain. It is not set by default. Starting from OpenSSL version 1.1.1h a check to disallow certificates in the chain that have explicitly encoded elliptic curve parameters was added as an additional strict check. An error in the implementation of this check meant that the result of a previous check to confirm that certificates in the chain are valid CA certificates was overwritten. This effectively bypasses the check that non-CA certificates must not be able to issue other certificates. If a \"purpose\" has been configured then there is a subsequent opportunity for checks that the certificate is a valid CA. All of the named \"purpose\" values implemented in libcrypto perform this check. Therefore, where a purpose is set the certificate chain will still be rejected even when the strict flag has been used. A purpose is set by default in libssl client and server certificate verification routines, but it can be overridden or removed by an application. In order to be affected, an application must explicitly set the X509_V_FLAG_X509_STRICT verification flag and either not set a purpose for the certificate verification or, in the case of TLS client or server applications, override the default purpose. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1h and newer are affected by this issue. Users of these versions should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1k. OpenSSL 1.0.2 is not impacted by this issue. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1k (Affected 1.1.1h-1.1.1j).",

      "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbtrfs: fix race setting file private on concurrent lseek using same fd\n\nWhen doing concurrent lseek(2) system calls against the same file\ndescriptor, using multiple threads belonging to the same process, we have\na short time window where a race happens and can result in a memory leak.\n\nThe race happens like this:\n\n1) A program opens a file descriptor for a file and then spawns two\n   threads (with the pthreads library for example), lets call them\n   task A and task B;\n\n2) Task A calls lseek with SEEK_DATA or SEEK_HOLE and ends up at\n   file.c:find_desired_extent() while holding a read lock on the inode;\n\n3) At the start of find_desired_extent(), it extracts the file's\n   private_data pointer into a local variable named 'private', which has\n   a value of NULL;\n\n4) Task B also calls lseek with SEEK_DATA or SEEK_HOLE, locks the inode\n   in shared mode and enters file.c:find_desired_extent(), where it also\n   extracts file->private_data into its local variable 'private', which\n   has a NULL value;\n\n5) Because it saw a NULL file private, task A allocates a private\n   structure and assigns to the file structure;\n\n6) Task B also saw a NULL file private so it also allocates its own file\n   private and then assigns it to the same file structure, since both\n   tasks are using the same file descriptor.\n\n   At this point we leak the private structure allocated by task A.\n\nBesides the memory leak, there's also the detail that both tasks end up\nusing the same cached state record in the private structure (struct\nbtrfs_file_private::llseek_cached_state), which can result in a\nuse-after-free problem since one task can free it while the other is\nstill using it (only one task took a reference count on it). Also, sharing\nthe cached state is not a good idea since it could result in incorrect\nresults in the future - right now it should not be a problem because it\nend ups being used only in extent-io-tree.c:count_range_bits() where we do\nrange validation before using the cached state.\n\nFix this by protecting the private assignment and check of a file while\nholding the inode's spinlock and keep track of the task that allocated\nthe private, so that it's used only by that task in order to prevent\nuser-after-free issues with the cached state record as well as potentially\nusing it incorrectly in the future.",

An uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability exists after version 2.3.0 through version 2.7.0. Within the URI template implementation in Addressable, a maliciously crafted template may result in uncontrolled resource consumption, leading to denial of service when matched against a URI. In typical usage, templates would not normally be read from untrusted user input, but nonetheless, no previous security advisory for Addressable has cautioned against doing this. Users of the parsing capabilities in Addressable but not the URI template capabilities are unaffected. The vulnerability is patched in version 2.8.0. As a workaround, only create Template objects from trusted sources that have been validated not to produce catastrophic backtracking.",

This bypasses the initial check that uploaded files are image files. The application relies on frontend checks to restrict the administrator from changing the extension of uploaded files to .php. This restriction is easily bypassed with any proxy tool (e.g., BurpSuite). Once the attacker renames the file, and gives it the .php extension, a GET request can be used to trigger the execution of code on the server.",

      "description": "In containerd (an industry-standard container runtime) before version 1.2.14 there is a credential leaking vulnerability. If a container image manifest in the OCI Image format or Docker Image V2 Schema 2 format includes a URL for the location of a specific image layer (otherwise known as a \u201cforeign layer\u201d), the default containerd resolver will follow that URL to attempt to download it. In v1.2.x but not 1.3.0 or later, the default containerd resolver will provide its authentication credentials if the server where the URL is located presents an HTTP 401 status code along with registry-specific HTTP headers. If an attacker publishes a public image with a manifest that directs one of the layers to be fetched from a web server they control and they trick a user or system into pulling the image, they can obtain the credentials used for pulling that image. In some cases, this may be the user's username and password for the registry. In other cases, this may be the credentials attached to the cloud virtual instance which can grant access to other cloud resources in the account. The default containerd resolver is used by the cri-containerd plugin (which can be used by Kubernetes), the ctr development tool, and other client programs that have explicitly linked against it. This vulnerability has been fixed in containerd 1.2.14. containerd 1.3 and later are not affected. If you are using containerd 1.3 or later, you are not affected. If you are using cri-containerd in the 1.2 series or prior, you should ensure you only pull images from trusted sources. Other container runtimes built on top of containerd but not using the default resolver (such as Docker) are not affected.",

      "description": "containerd is an industry-standard container runtime and is available as a daemon for Linux and Windows. In containerd before versions 1.3.9 and 1.4.3, the containerd-shim API is improperly exposed to host network containers. Access controls for the shim\u2019s API socket verified that the connecting process had an effective UID of 0, but did not otherwise restrict access to the abstract Unix domain socket. This would allow malicious containers running in the same network namespace as the shim, with an effective UID of 0 but otherwise reduced privileges, to cause new processes to be run with elevated privileges. This vulnerability has been fixed in containerd 1.3.9 and 1.4.3. Users should update to these versions as soon as they are released. It should be noted that containers started with an old version of containerd-shim should be stopped and restarted, as running containers will continue to be vulnerable even after an upgrade. If you are not providing the ability for untrusted users to start containers in the same network namespace as the shim (typically the \"host\" network namespace, for example with docker run --net=host or hostNetwork: true in a Kubernetes pod) and run with an effective UID of 0, you are not vulnerable to this issue. If you are running containers with a vulnerable configuration, you can deny access to all abstract sockets with AppArmor by adding a line similar to deny unix addr=@**, to your policy. It is best practice to run containers with a reduced set of privileges, with a non-zero UID, and with isolated namespaces. The containerd maintainers strongly advise against sharing namespaces with the host. Reducing the set of isolation mechanisms used for a container necessarily increases that container's privilege, regardless of what container runtime is used for running that container.",

Note that on Linux with the `uffd` feature enabled, it is only possible to trigger the bug from a resource limiter as the call to `mprotect` is skipped.

      "description": "`discourse-microsoft-auth` is a plugin that enables authentication via Microsoft. On sites with the `discourse-microsoft-auth` plugin enabled, an attack can potentially take control of a victim's Discourse account. Sites that have configured their application's account type to any options other than `Accounts in this organizational directory only (O365 only - Single tenant)` are vulnerable. This vulnerability has been patched in commit c40665f44509724b64938c85def9fb2e79f62ec8 of `discourse-microsoft-auth`. A `microsoft_auth:revoke` rake task has also been added which will deactivate and log out all users that have connected their accounts to Microsoft. User API keys as well as API keys created by those users will also be revoked. The rake task will also remove the connection records to Microsoft for those users. This will allow affected users to re-verify their account emails as well as reconnect their Discourse account to Microsoft for authentication. As a workaround, disable the `discourse-microsoft-auth` plugin by setting the `microsoft_auth_enabled` site setting to `false`. Run the `microsoft_auth:log_out_users` rake task to log out all users with associated Microsoft accounts.\n",
